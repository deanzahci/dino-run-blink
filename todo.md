- Sliding window voting system improvement (tune `SLIDING_WINDOW_SIZE` / `SLIDING_WINDOW_THRESHOLD`; consider hysteresis or weighting)
- Automated calibration option
    - Percentile-based statistics (e.g., 95th percentile)
    - Standard-deviation-based thresholding (mean + k * std)
- Add unit tests
    - Mocked `pylsl` stream tests for `stream()` behavior
    - `PADLEN` enforcement and filter `padlen` usage tests
    - Sliding-window voting tests (false-positive/negative scenarios)
    - Calibration method tests
